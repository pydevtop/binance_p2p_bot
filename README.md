## Advantages of the BinanceBot bot in trading on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange?
The bot works on the Binance API - this makes it possible to buy orders very quickly

The bot is multitasking - it can perform several tasks at the same time (you can simultaneously buy orders for different cryptocurrencies)

The choice of currency (fiat) and payment methods (banks) in the bot is dynamic and pulled directly from the Binance exchange - this makes it possible to buy cryptocurrency for any currency in any country

After launching the task (order) you created, the bot will monitor prices on the Binance P2P exchange, and as soon as the price appears below the one set in the task you created, the bot will open a deal and notify you in a telegram
